## Reflection

Part 1: 
In this part, I felt tidying gapminder dataframe is not an easy task, especially for the third task. In the last lask, I need to reshape table to one row per year * continent combination. I spent a lot time on it and finally reshaped successfully, but I donot think it is a good work.  

Part 2: 
This part is a straight forward process, not very tough. I just create a new data frame from a downloaded WHO dataset and then use some join functions to join with gapminder dataset.
